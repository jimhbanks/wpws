          <p class="card-text">Since 2003, Code has been delivering large-scale digital projects for some of the world’s biggest brands. To make sure that all our projects are delivered ‘right, first time and on time’, we have developed a detailed process model which we follow with all clients. This process is called ACT.</br></br>
				ACT starts with a Vision of the people who will use our application, what they will do and why they would want to.  Ideas are refined through a process of Value Engineering to ensure that every penny spent is contributing value. We embrace rapid prototyping and collaborative UX design and our development is delivered in iterations, allowing clients continuous to review the product and adapt it as business needs change. Throughout, clients have full visibility 24/7 of our work and can engage their dedicated Client Consultant at any time.
